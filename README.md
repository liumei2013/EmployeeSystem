## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired when learning Java and Spring Boot. I am curious to explore how Java code is implemented in the real world! Hence I create this project as a little experiment.
- As a newer of Spring Boot, I have encountered a lot of problems of errors and exceptions. By debugging those errors, I thereby accumulated much more hands-on debug skills than before.
